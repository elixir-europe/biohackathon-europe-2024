BioHackathon Europe is an annual event that brings together bioinformaticians and computational biologists from around the world. It’s organised by [ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org/), and offers an intense week of hacking, with participants working on diverse and exciting projects. BioHackathon is a community-driven event, which provides an opportunity for members of the life sciences community to meet and work together on topics of common interest. **The goal is to create code that addresses challenges in bioinformatics research.** 

This year we are holding the BioHackathon at Hotel Esplanade Resort in Berlin, Germany from 3 to 7 November (see the [Venue page](/venue/)), with remote access available if you cannot attend in person. **Registration will open in June 2025 – the exact date will be confirmed before then.**

Maybe just include them (but less intuitive to edit that way).

## Scope
The BioHackathon provides space for collaboration and innovation in computational biology and bioinformatics. Participants engage in intensive, hands-on programming and content-creation activities, data integration and software development. The topics are aligned with the needs of [Platforms](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms), [Communities](https://elixir-europe.org/communities) and [Focus Groups](https://elixir-europe.org/focus-groups), as captured in the ELIXIR Scientific Programme.

## Goals
The key objective of BioHackathon Europe is to advance the development of an open-source service infrastructure to accelerate scientific innovation. We focus on areas that support the work of ELIXIR Platforms, Communities and Focus Groups, covering areas such as FAIR principles, identifiers, metadata standards, ontologies and metadata catalogues by engaging technical experts in the bioinformatics community, both within and beyond ELIXIR, to collaborate on topics of common interest aligned with ELIXIR activities.
